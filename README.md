# odin-recipes

This project consists of 3 recipes.

This puts together all the basic HTML and VCS knowledge that The Odin Project has taught up to this point.

On the HTML front, it will be an application of:
    -elements involving text, such as <p>, <h1>, <strong>, etc.
    -link and image elements, <a> and <img>
    -like all HTML files, the HTML boilerplate

For VCS, we have:
    -applying the Git workflow(editing, staging, committing)
    -creating and managing repositories
    -creating effective commit messages
